Instructions:
1. Fork this repo and use this project as your base
2. Complete the given objectives for your prototype

- Create a system for a local two player game with a single camera and separate inputs/controls for each player.
- Each player must move separately and have completely separate control inputs.
- There must be at least some type of objective for the players. This could be a puzzle to solve, combat between the two players, or PvE combat where the players fight enemies in the game.

Your code can be as messy, terrible, and unoptimized as you want! This is only a prototype

# What is Rapid Prototyping?
Rapid prototyping in video game development refers to the process of quickly creating playable versions of game concepts or features to test their feasibility, gameplay mechanics, and overall fun factor. It's a crucial phase in game development that allows designers and developers to iterate on ideas rapidly, gather feedback, and refine the game before investing significant time and resources into full production.
